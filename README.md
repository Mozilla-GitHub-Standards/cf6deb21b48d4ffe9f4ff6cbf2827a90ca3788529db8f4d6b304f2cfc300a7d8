# GSuite Cloud Users Driver

The purpose of this driver is to ensure that all users with a getpocket.com, mozillafoundation.com, and mozilla.com
email have the ability to single-sign-on into GCP and manage the life cycle of those accounts.  

# Roadmap

1. Q1 2019 switch over to user person-api v2
2. Automate Google Groups provisioning based on other data.
3. Add more test coverage.
